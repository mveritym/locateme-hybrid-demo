# locateme-hybrid-demo

To run the web component of this hybrid app:
```
cd locateme-hybrid-demo/locate-me-web/app
npm install
node app.js
```

You should see the message
```
Demo hybrid web app listening at http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

Now open the Objective-C app in XCode, choose a simulator and run the application. You will need to [simulate a location](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-debugger/articles/simulating_locations.html) for the location finder piece to work correctly.
